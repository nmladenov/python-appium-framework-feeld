The test is not valid per requirements
The issue is that we do not validate the values - the name of the first profile and the second profile as well!

Requirements:
```
It is supposed to check whether skipping first profile results in displaying the second one in the
discover list
```

Note: The test is still validating
1. Swiping
2. skipping is working
3. profile appear after swipe/skip
